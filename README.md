# react-portfolio
Install create-react-app by running the command npm install -g create-react-app
Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
Run the command create-react-app my-app to create a new React application. This will set up a new React project with a basic file structure and some default configuration.
Once the setup is complete, navigate into the project directory by running cd my-app.
You can start the development server by running npm start, which will open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000/.
You will see the default "Welcome to React" page.
You can start building your application by editing the files in the src directory. By default, src/index.js is the entry point for the application and src/App.js contains the root component.
When you are ready to deploy your application, you can create a production-ready build by running npm run build. This will create an optimized build in the build directory.
You can deploy the build folder by any static server, for example using a package like serve and running serve -s build.
