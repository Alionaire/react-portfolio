        My name is Alithemba Makongwana and I am currently a computer science student at Walter Sisulu University. I have always had a passion for technology and programming, and I am excited to take the next step in my career by becoming a software developer at SovTech.
I am drawn to software development because of the constant evolution and innovation in the field and at SovTech you achieve all of that. I am excited by the opportunity to create new and useful applications that make people's lives easier and more efficient. 
<br/> <br/>
I am also fascinated by the problem-solving aspect of software development and the satisfaction of seeing a project come to fruition as specified in the SovTech Spex. I would also like to be a part of an agile development team, where I can work with others to create high-quality software that meets the needs of the users
I believe everything is an Art when you put your consciousness in it. You can connect with me via social links.
